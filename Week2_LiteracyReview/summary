#In this week, Yihan Jiao reviewed the applicability of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF),
Naive Bayes (NB), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for phishing email detection. 
highlighted their advantages, disadvantages, and recommended a comprehensive approach for the Capstone project, 
focusing on feature engineering, model optimization, and evaluation.

#This week, Guoyu Zhang studied supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. 
Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled data and include techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), 
Na√Øve Bayes, and Decision Trees. Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data and are used to identify patterns and structures in data, 
with common algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-Means Clustering.
