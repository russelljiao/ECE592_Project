2024/05/29 Added Preprocess.py
           The file contains preprocess steps for the email dataset. Including cleaning out Null data entries, convert messages into lowercase, and potential spam keyword detection (for separate normal emails from spam, used for generate classification).
           Work in progress.

2024/05/30 Added mean_cov_engineering.mlx
           The file transforms the points to create target mean and covariance, used to explore the given dataset. Mainly for researching the impacts of outliers, and the possibile classification technique: bayesian decision.

2024/05/31 Added LiteracyReview
           The file introduced the possibile classification technique, Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in phishing email detection, summarizing their strengths and challenges.

2024/06/03 Added explore_mean_boundary.mlx
           The file explores the change of mean and impacts to the boundaries, which shows sparse means can lead to more clear boundaries. For this dataset, it is meaningful to regularize or remove the outliers to generate means.

2024/06/04 Added explore_prior_boundary.mlx
           The file discuss the impacts of changing priors, which indicates the prior of the class in the dataset can significantly influences the boundary. It is a good choice to try or estimate proper priors.

2024/06/05 Added explore_outlier_boundary.mlx
           The file generates a few outliers and discuss the impacts to the boundaries.
