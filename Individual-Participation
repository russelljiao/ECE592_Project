2024/05/29 Added Preprocess.py
           The file contains preprocess steps for the email dataset. Including cleaning out Null data entries, convert messages into lowercase, and potential spam keyword detection (for separate normal emails from spam, used for generate classification).
           Work in progress.

2024/05/30 Literature review on phishing email detection papers.
           Look into suitable baseline classifiers for our problem.

2024/05/30 Added mean_cov_engineering.mlx
           The file transforms the points to create target mean and covariance, used to explore the given dataset. Mainly for researching the impacts of outliers, and the possibile classification technique: bayesian decision.

2024/05/31 Added LiteracyReview
           The file introduced the possibile classification technique, Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in phishing email detection, summarizing their strengths and challenges.

2024/5/31 Added LiteracyReview
          This week, Guoyu Zhang studied supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled data and include techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), 
          Naïve Bayes, and Decision Trees. Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data and are used to identify patterns and structures in data, with common algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-Means Clustering.

2024/06/03 Added explore_mean_boundary.mlx
           The file explores the change of mean and impacts to the boundaries, which shows sparse means can lead to more clear boundaries. For this dataset, it is meaningful to regularize or remove the outliers to generate means.

2024/06/04 Added explore_prior_boundary.mlx
           The file discuss the impacts of changing priors, which indicates the prior of the class in the dataset can significantly influences the boundary. It is a good choice to try or estimate proper priors.
           --- Hui Xu V01029720
2024/06/05 Added explore_outlier_boundary.mlx
           The file generates a few outliers and discuss the impacts to the boundaries.

2024/06/06 Added a python file for new preprocessing + KNN approach to see any features in the scam file
           --- Renhou Zhang V01037648
2024/06/06 Added asset folder for data set and utils
           Added vol3D, and .mat to asset folder for matlab livescript consumption

2024/06/06 Added logistic_regression.ipynb. 
           Learned logistic regression model for classification problem.
           Played with toy dataset to explore logistic regression and prepare 
           for adaptation to our phishing email classification problem.

2024/06/09 Data Processing

		Load dataset.
		Fill missing values.
		Clean text (remove HTML tags, URLs, special characters, digits, convert to lowercase, remove stop words).
		Combine cleaned ‘Subject’ and ‘Body’ text.

            Feature Extraction

		Initialize TF-IDF Vectorizer (limit to 500 features).
		Transform cleaned text to TF-IDF matrix.
		Convert TF-IDF matrix to DataFrame.
		Save TF-IDF features to CSV.
